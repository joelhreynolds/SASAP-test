```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lattice)
```

Read in data from KNB [here](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/df35b.304.2)
```{r GetData, echo=FALSE}
#reads in data from knb
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
some graphics
```{r SimplePlots, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
xyplot(Chinook~Year|Region, data= catch_df,scales="free")
xyplot(Sockeye~Year|Region, data= catch_df,scales="free")
xyplot(Coho~Year|Region, data= catch_df,scales="free")
xyplot(Pink~Year|Region, data= catch_df,scales="free")
xyplot(Chum~Year|Region, data= catch_df,scales="free")

```

Clean up the data (tidy it).
```{r TidyData_Pipes, echo=FALSE}

catch_df <- catch_df %>% #pipe data into select
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% # now convert wide to long
  gather(key="Species", value="Catch", -Region, -Year) %>% 
  #have to ignore Region and Year and just deal on other columns
  rename(catch_thousands=Catch) # Commercial Catch is in thousands 
```

```{r Tidy_Spread, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# to go long to wide
catch_df %>%
  spread(key="Species", value = "Catch") %>%
  head()
```


Add columns after correcting error in catch column.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# there is an error in the dataset due to the optical character recognition - a '1' got read in as an 'I'.
# did some exploration to resolve problem but this final code does the error correction explicitly so reproducible.
catch_df <- catch_df %>%
  mutate(catch_thousands=ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1, catch_thousands)) %>%
  mutate(catch_thousands = as.integer(catch_thousands)) %>%
  mutate(Catch=catch_thousands*1000)  
```

# Analysis

```{r Grouping, echo=FALSE}

annual_catch <- catch_df %>%
  filter(Species=="Chinook") %>%
  group_by(Region, Year) %>%
  summarize(mean_catch = mean(Catch), num_obs=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_catch))  #arrange by descencing order

  head(annual_catch, 30)
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
